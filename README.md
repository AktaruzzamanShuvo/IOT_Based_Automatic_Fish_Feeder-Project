# IOT_Based_Automatic_Fish_Feeder-Project

Project Details:
In this project ESP8266 NodeMCU is used to controll the two motor of the fish feeder.One motor is controlled by 5V relay module(active low) and another motor is controlled by BTS 7960 motor driver to control the RPM of motor driver.To control the system from mobile app, Blynk IOT is included Here.
Here the fish feeder will spread food for fish in a pond or some other place from its reservior everyday at two fixed time ( like: 5:15am and 4:12pm).There is another option to turning on the fish feeder from Blynk IOT app.

There is used ntp server to track the time from internet.

This is an undergraduate project.Only the programming & circuit part is uploaded here,not the full design.
